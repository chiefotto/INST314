Difference-denying feminism has been influential in academic and intellectual circles, particularly in the fields of gender studies, feminist theory, and critical theory. This approach has helped to deconstruct traditional gender roles and has highlighted the ways in which gender is socially constructed.

Difference-removing feminism has been influential in certain activist circles, particularly in relation to reproductive rights and technologies. This approach has been associated with debates around the use of technologies such as contraception, abortion, and assisted reproduction, and has highlighted the ways in which reproductive technologies can be used to challenge traditional gender roles.

Difference-honoring feminism has been influential in a range of contexts, including academia, activism, and public policy. This approach has emphasized the importance of acknowledging and valuing both cultural and essential differences between men and women, and has been associated with movements and policies aimed at promoting gender equality and challenging gender stereotypes.

It's difficult to say which approach has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades, as their influence has been felt in different ways and to different degrees in different contexts. However, it's clear that all three approaches have contributed to ongoing debates around gender, equality, and social justice, and have helped to shape our understanding of these issues in important ways.",No,32,Male,Territory Manager / Buyer|Procurment (Broadliner - Food Distribution)
